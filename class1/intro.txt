 C Basics: variable names

 - Must begin with a letter or an underscore
 - cannot start with a digit

 - can be follow by any combo of letters digits or underscore
 - cannot contain reserved words ( example: "function", "do" )

 C: intrinsic data types 
 - char (character)
 - typically 1 byte
 - 'a', 'b', 'c', '2'

 - int (integer)

 - typically 4 bytes
 - 16 (decimal), 020 (octal), 0x10 (hex)

 float ( floating point)

 - typically 4 bytes

 -0.00225, 2.25e-3

 - double ( extended precision float)
- typically 8 bytes
- unless told otherwise ( e.g 3.14f) floating point literals are assumed to be double


c: Modifiers
    - log, long long , short, unsigned and signed
    - long, long long extended on some systems
    - can be used with int, double
    - short - takes half spaces on some systems
    - signed/usnigned ( int or char)
